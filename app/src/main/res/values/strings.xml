    <string name="hiv_intro">Introduction</string>
    <string name="hiv_introduction">HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a retrovirus that infects the vital organs and cells of the human immune system (CD4 cells),
        which is our body’s natural defence against illness. HIV infection is one of non-curable sexually transmitted infections.
        If HIV is left untreated, it may take up to 10 or 15 years for the immune system to be so severely damaged it can no longer defend itself at all. However, the speed HIV progresses will vary depending on age, health and background\n
        \u2022 AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) refers to a set of symptoms and illnesses, (or syndrome) that occur at the very final stage of HIV infection \n
        \u2022 The disease alters the immune system, making people much more vulnerable to infections and diseases \n
        \u2022 A person is said to have AIDS when their immune system is too weak to fight off infection, and they develop certain defining symptoms and illnesses \n

    <string name="hiv_stages">Stages</string>
    <string name="stage1">Acute Primary Infection </string>
    <string name="stage1_details">
        Around one to four weeks after becoming infected with HIV, some people will experience symptoms that can feel a lot like flu.
        This may not last long (a week or two) These symptoms can happen because your body is reacting to the HIV virus. The symptoms of HIV can differ from person-to-person and some people may not get any symptoms at all for many years\n\n
        The flu like symptoms of (in the early HIV infection) may include:\n
        \u2022 fever (raised temperature)\n
        \u2022 body rash\n
        \u2022 sore throat\n

    <string name="stage2">The Asymptomatic Stage</string>
    <string name="stage2_details">
        HIV virus may not reveal any other symptoms for up to 10 or even 15 years (depending on age, background and overall health). However, the virus will still be active \n
        <b><i>NB:</i></b> Because many people do not have any symptoms for stages 1 and 2, HIV often gets transmitted from people who simply don’t know they are infected \n
    </string>
    <string name="stage3">Symptomatic HIV Infection\n(Late-stage HIV Infection)</string>
    <string name="stage3_details">
        At this stage, the immune system has been so badly damaged that it can no longer fight off serious infections and diseases. This stage of infection is known as AIDS
    </string>

    <string name="hiv_syptoms">Symptoms</string>
    <string name="hiv_syptoms_details">

        Diagnosis is made through a blood test that screens specifically for the virus. If the HIV virus has been found, the test result is "positive". The blood is re-tested several times before a positive result is given to the patient\n\n
        If a person has been exposed to the virus, it is crucial that they get tested as soon as possible. A person who is at risk of acquiring HIV should be tested every 3 months. The earlier HIV is detected, the more likely the treatment will be successful\n

    <string name="hiv_transmission">Transmission</string>
    <string name="hiv_transmission_details">
        The person-to-person spread of HIV is called HIV transmission. HIV is transmitted (spread) only in certain body fluids from a person infected with HIV\n\n
        HIV transmission is only possible if these fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or are directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe)\n\n
        <b><i>Sexual Transmission:</i></b> it can happen when there is sexual contact with a person infected with HIV. This can happen while having unprotected sex HIV is transmitted (spread) only in certain body fluids from a person infected with HIV such as Semen, Pre-seminal fluids, Rectal fluids and Vaginal fluids \n\n
        <b><i>Perinatal Transmission</i></b> a mother can pass the infection on to her child during childbirth, pregnancy, and also through breastfeeding. This spread of HIV is called mother-to-child transmission of HIV\n\n
        <b><i>Blood Transmission</i></b> the risk of transmitting HIV through blood transfusion is nowadays extremely low in developed countries, thanks to meticulous screening and precautions However, among injection or IV drug users, sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood is extremely hazardous\n\n

        Anyone can get HIV, but you can take steps to protect yourself from HIV infection. The following are list of prevention steps:\n
        \u2022 <b><i>Abstain from sex\n</i></b>
        \u2022 <b><i>Get tested and know your partner’s HIV status:</i></b> Talk to your partner about HIV testing and get tested before you have sex \n
        \u2022 <b><i>Have less risky sex:</i></b> HIV is mainly spread by having anal or vaginal sex without a condom \n
        \u2022 <b><i>Use condoms:</i></b> Use a condom correctly every time you have sex\n
        \u2022 <b><i>Limit your number of sexual partners:</i></b> The more partners you have, the more likely you are to have a partner with HIV whose HIV is not well controlled or to have a partner with a sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) \n
        \u2022 <b><i>Get tested and treated for STDs:</i></b> Insist that your partners get tested and treated too. Having an STD can increase your risk of becoming infected with HIV or spreading it to others\n
        \u2022 <b><i>Don’t inject drugs:</i></b> But if you do, use only sterile drug injection equipment and water and never share your equipment with others\n
        \u2022 <b><i>Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): </i></b> PEP is the use of HIV medicines to reduce the risk of HIV infection soon after a possible exposure to HIV. PEP may be used, for example, after a person has sex without a condom with a person who is infected with HIV or after a health care worker is accidentally exposed to HIV in the workplace. To be effective, PEP must be started within 3 days after the possible exposure to HIV. PEP involves taking HIV medicines each day for 28 days\n
        \u2022 Every pregnant women is tested for HIV\n
        \u2022 HIV positive people need to consult their health care provider before getting pregnant\n
        \u2022 <b><i>Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV:</i></b> Women with HIV take HIV medicines during pregnancy and childbirth to reduce the risk of passing HIV to their babies. Their newborn babies also receive HIV medicine for 4 to 6 weeks after birth\n

        <b><i>Infection</i></b> of uterine tissue can result from use of contaminated instruments or when tissue remains in the uterus\n
        \u2022 Symptoms include those of incomplete abortion as well as fever, chills, and foul-smelling vaginal discharge and uterine tenderness. Most often, symptoms appear two to three days after the abortion\n
        \u2022 Treatment involves antibiotics and vacuum aspiration if needed to remove the remaining tissue in the uterus
        <b><i>Heavy bleeding</i></b> results when an incomplete abortion is not treated or from some abortion techniques such as dilation and curettage or insertion of sticks or other objects into the cervix\n
        \u2022 Heavy bleeding also can be triggered by toxic reactions caused by herbs, drugs, or chemicals that are swallowed or placed in the vagina\n
        \u2022 Treatment may require removing remaining tissue in the uterus and administration of drugs to stop the bleeding, intravenous fluid replacement, and, in severe cases, blood transfusion or surgery\n
        <b><i>Uterine perforation</i></b> can occur when a sharp object or instrument is inserted into the uterus\n
        \u2022 Other organs also can be injured, including the cervix, ovaries, bowel, bladder, and rectum\n
        \u2022 Observation and antibiotics may be all that is needed as treatment, but in more severe cases, surgery may be needed to repair damage to bowel, blood vessels, or other organs\n
        NB: Untreated, these complications can cause disabilities and chronic conditions that include: chronic pelvic pain; pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the reproductive organs; and infertility\n

        Some STIs are curable while few are not STIs that are caused by bacteria, like chlamydia, syphilis and Gonorrhoea, can be cured with antibiotics. But STIs caused by a virus (like HIV or herpes) can’t be cured. Your doctor can only treat the symptoms that the virus causes Don’t wait to be treated. Early treatment helps prevent serious health problems\n\n
        See your doctor if you’re at risk for having an STI, if you have any of the symptoms, or if you have concerns about whether you have one STIs can cause serious health problems if left untreated. For example, chlamydia can lead to problems that can cause women not to be able to have children (infertility). HPV can lead to cancer of the cervix or penis, and syphilis can lead to paralysis, mental problems, heart damage, blindness and even death
